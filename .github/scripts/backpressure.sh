AGENT_PROMPT="
Read the following PRD. For each unchecked task, generate exactly the files described in that task — no more, no less.

Read package.json before generating tests to understand which dependencies and test runners are available.

You are running in non-interactive mode, if you have a question, pick the solution which does not break an existing constraint.

- DO NOT write application source code. Only write config files and test files.
- Treat each checkbox item as a single atomic unit of work.
  - When finished, each task should have only a single file to execute to validate the task.
  - If a task includes a \`[test: command]\` annotation, extract the file path and test runner from it.
  - The generated test file MUST match the exact path in the annotation (e.g., \`[test: npx jest tests/foo.test.ts]\` → create \`tests/foo.test.ts\`).
  - The test runner specified in the annotation (jest, playwright, etc.) takes precedence over any inference from the task description.
  - If no \`[test: ...]\` annotation is present, fall back to inferring the tool, type, and path from the task description.
- Infer the correct tool and test type from the task description:
      - If the task involves a UI, use Playwright (write a \`.spec\` file).
      - If the task involves only code logic, use Jest (write a \`.test\` file).
      - If the task involves running a script or CLI tool, leverage a typechecking or linting tool, or write a small shell script in \`scripts/\`.
- The test file's own extension is chosen by the runner and the subject's language:                                                                                                            
    - TypeScript subject (.ts, .tsx) → .test.ts / .spec.ts
    - JavaScript subject (.js, .jsx, .mjs, .cjs) → .test.js / .spec.js                                                                                                                           
    - Non-code subjects (CSS, JSON, YAML, Markdown, shell, SQL, assets, config) — do not write a unit test. Validate via the appropriate tool: npx biome for lint/format, a JSON schema or node -e presence check, a shell script under scripts/ asserting exit codes, or npx tsc --noEmit for type-only concerns. Use whatever fits the [test: ...] annotation.
- Use imports without file extensions (e.g., import { foo } from './bar' not './bar.js') when possible. Do not use extensions if the import can be resolved without them.
- Use ONLY data-testid attributes as element selectors. Do not assume class names, routing paths, or component structure beyond what the PRD states.
- Assert on: visibility, text content, ARIA roles, and keyboard focus where relevant to the task.
- Tests should fail against a blank implementation — avoid trivially passing assertions (e.g. no expect(true).toBe(true)).
- Sanity tests must contain the minimum assertion described — do not expand them.
- Each test file must cover the following:
    - The primary happy path
    - The most likely failure or edge case
- All generated tests must FAIL if the task is not complete, such as having zero implementation code.
- Use a beforeEach block for any shared setup (navigation, auth state).

When finished, run the following quality gates in order:
- \`npm run lint\` — auto-fixes lint & formatting issues. Manually resolve any issues that cannot be auto-fixed.
- \`npm run check-types\` — verifies TypeScript compilation. Fix any type errors before finishing.

Then finally, run the tests and assert non-zero exit code.
